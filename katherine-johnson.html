Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician born in 1918. <b>She worked at NASA as a brilliant mathematician,</b>
where she calculated important flight paths for space missions. In her work,<u> Katherine helped calculate the trajectories for astronauts,</u>
which is why she is considered <u>one of the most important figures in space exploration.</u> She believed that math could help humans explore space,
and she is an important role model for girls in STEAM.
