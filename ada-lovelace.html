    Ada Lovelace was a British mathematician born in 1815. <b>She worked with Charles Babbage on the Analytical Engine, </b>
    an early mechanical computer. In her notes,<u> Ada wrote the first algorithm designed for a machine,</u> 
    which is why she is considered <u>the world’s first computer programmer.</u> She believed that computers could be creative, 
    combining logic and imagination, and she is an important role model for girls in STEAM.
